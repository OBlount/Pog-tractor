# Pog-tractor: A Twitch.tv measurement tool

A tool that can calculate the _'pog-rate'_ of a [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) streamer. With the Pog-tractor', we can measure streamer performance and pin-point moments in the stream where chat is going crazy. This can also point out 'streamer moments' and clips.

# Features

1. :white_check_mark: Listen to any streamers chat

# TODO

* :pushpin: Create the 'pog' formula
* :pushpin: Display data in a graphical way
* :pushpin: Alert when there is a _streamer moment_ with _'clip-able'_ potential
