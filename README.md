# Pog-tractor: A Twitch.tv measurement tool

A tool that can calculate the _'pog-rate'_ of a [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) streamer's channel. With the 'Pog-tractor', we can measure streamer performance, and graph out events in the stream where chat is going crazy. Finding clips has never been easier.

# Features

1. :white_check_mark: Listen to any streamers chat on [Twitch.Tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) for _'Pogs'_ and _'PogChamps'_

# TODO

* :pushpin: Display data in a graphical way
* :pushpin: Alert the user when there is a _streamer moment_ with _'clip-able'_ potential
